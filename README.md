# Live-Speech-Transcription-using-Deep-Learning-
This is a video conferencing web application that has live speech transcription powered by Neural Networks.
The app is created using flask.
We will create this web app in two modules:
 1.The Front End that has the user interface being a video call 
 2. The backend that will house our automatic speech recognition system.
 We will use Tensorflow library to create our deep learning model that will have a Convolutional Neural Network, an RNN (LSTM layer) and will be trained using the CTC beam serch 
 this is experimental
